# AQL-CAOCAP  = (🧠+🪐)
The Future of Software Development is (Agentic Query Languages + Coding Agents Orchestration + Coding Agents Programming)


> *"The most dangerous thought you can have as a creative person is to think you know what you're doing."*
> — Bret Victor, [The Future of Programming](https://youtu.be/8pTEmbeENF4)


Hi ✋🏼, I'm Azzam Alrashed. 
IDK what I'm doing, this project is my passion project & working on it is my unique way of having fun! 

My dev journey started when a freelancer asked for more money to keep developing my simple app and I was broke....
So in 2018, with only 2 years of dev-XP I decided to develop an app for non-technical users.
That will make it super E.S.C.F (easy, simple, cheap & fun) to turn any **idea into software**.

>  How Hard Can It Be?

>  I fried a my brain trying to figure it out. Eventually, I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1... looking at the bright side of it you can say it's a superpower. 


**AQL CAOCAP is the refusal to accept today's software development process as the final form.**

**AQL CAOCAP is not defined by any single interface, feature, or implementation. It is a relentless belief that the software development process can be improved, and a commitment to keep pushing until building software feels closer to thinking.**

AqlCaocap is bigger than the current implementation. the current implementation is not the doctrine. It's just an experiment in service of the larger act: challenging the inherited shape of software development and building better ways to ( ideas -> software ).

```
func aqlCaocap(i: Idea) -> Software {
   var app: Software()
   // ....?
   return app
}
```

## The Mission

**Relentlessly improve the act of building software.**

CAOCAP starts from a simple belief: the developer experience we inherited is not sacred. Every ritual can be questioned. Every boundary can be pushed. Every slow, fragmented, overcomplicated step between an idea and a working system is a place where the future can be brought closer.

This project is not here to defend one feature, one interface, one platform, or one "new way" to program. It is here to keep asking:

- What if building software felt more immediate?
- What if tools amplified imagination instead of interrupting it?
- What if AI collaboration stayed human-in-the-loop, inspectable, and grounded in the project itself?
- What if the development environment became a medium for thought, not just a container for files?

CAOCAP is the collaborative act of pushing the software development world forward.

---

## Principles

- **No final form** — Today's development process is not the endpoint. It is material to be improved.
- **Developer experience first** — Speed, clarity, agency, and creative flow matter as core engineering concerns.
- **Implementation is not identity** — The current app is a vessel for the mission, not the limit of the mission.
- **Human-in-the-loop agents** — AI should expand the developer's control, not hide changes or erase authorship.
- **Directness over ceremony** — The path from intent to working software should keep getting shorter, clearer, and more inspectable.
- **Experiment in public** — CAOCAP grows through building, testing, shipping, learning, and pushing again.

---

## The Current Artifact

The first product expression of CAOCAP is a native iOS/iPadOS app.

CAOCAP explores a development environment where your software requirements, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, live preview, and AI collaborator can share one workspace. It is intentionally local-first, direct-manipulation-heavy, and built around the belief that programming tools can feel more alive than a stack of tabs and terminals.

The spatial model matters because it is one strong experiment in improving development. The agentic model matters because it is another. Neither is the whole point. The whole point is the relentless improvement of how software gets made.

---

## What CAOCAP Does Today

When you create a new project in CAOCAP, you open a workspace with five interconnected nodes already wired together:

```text
[SRS] ----------- [HTML] ---- [Live Preview]
                     |
               +-----+-----+
             [CSS]       [JavaScript]
```

- **SRS Node** — Write software requirements in a distraction-free Notion-style editor.
- **HTML Node** — Edit full HTML structure with native syntax highlighting and a line-number gutter.
- **CSS Node** — Style your app with real-time syntax highlighting for properties, selectors, and values.
- **JavaScript Node** — Add interactivity with keyword, comment, and string highlighting.
- **Live Preview Node** — Render the compiled app in a 9:16 `WKWebView`, with full-screen immersive preview available on tap.

Every time you edit code and tap **Done**, the Live Compilation Engine merges the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript nodes into one document and pushes it to the WebView automatically.

---

## The CoCaptain

CAOCAP's agentic path is expressed today through **CoCaptain**, an AI collaborator that understands the current project graph.

- **Context-aware intelligence**: CoCaptain reads the SRS requirements, HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript logic through `ProjectContextBuilder`.
- **Agentic control**: CoCaptain can propose precise `nodeEdits` or trigger typed `AppActions`, such as creating a new node.
- **Human-in-the-loop review**: AI-proposed code changes become review items that can be inspected before they are applied.
- **Firebase AI Logic**: The current implementation streams model responses through Firebase AI Logic for low-latency collaboration.

CoCaptain is not meant to replace the developer. It is meant to make the development environment more responsive to intent while preserving inspection, authorship, and control.

## Current Status

**Phase 0: MVP** — Released on the App Store.

The current app implementation is fully functional:

- ✅ Infinite canvas with node linking
- ✅ Native syntax-highlighted code editors for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- ✅ Live compilation engine with a 500ms debounce
- ✅ Full-screen WebView previewing
- ✅ CoCaptain agentic assistant with multi-turn chat and context harvesting
- ✅ Firebase Authentication with Apple, Google, and GitHub
- ✅ StoreKit 2 Pro monetization
- ✅ App Store release
- ⏳ Post-launch onboarding polish

The current product priority is post-launch hardening: preserving trust with real users, improving first-run retention, and expanding CoCaptain into the next meaningful "wow" loop.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full breakdown.

## Getting Started

CAOCAP requires **Xcode 15+** and an iOS 17+ simulator or device.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Azzam-Alrashed/CAOCAP-CAOCAP.git

# 2. Open in Xcode
open CAOCAP-CAOCAP/ios-app/caocap/caocap.xcodeproj

# 3. Select a target and run (Cmd+R)
```

> [!TIP]
> Run on a physical iPhone for the best current CAOCAP experience. The direct manipulation model feels dramatically better on real hardware.
